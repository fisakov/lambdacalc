# Type Checking Lambda Calculus

This is a demo of type checking simply typed lambda calculus using constraint rules.

This project is made with [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/) using the [plugin](https://github.com/fisakov/constraints-typechecking) that provides an experimental feature: type checking with constraint rules.


## Instructions

1. Install the latest version of [JetBrains MPS](https://www.jetbrains.com/mps/download) (2017.1)
2. Download the type checking plugin from [this](https://github.com/fisakov/constraints-typechecking) project (see downloads for the latest release)
3. Install the plugin to your local drive (example for macOS): 

    `unzip typechecking-0.1.zip -d ~/Library/Application\ Support/MPS2017.1/`

4. Clone this repository and open the project with MPS
